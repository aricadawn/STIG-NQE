The flow of all network traffic must be monitored and controlled so it does not introduce any unacceptable risk to the network infrastructure or data. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems. 

Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, switches, guards, encrypted tunnels, and firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics).",,"Review the switch configuration to verify that ACLs are configured to allow or deny traffic for specific source and destination addresses as well as ports and protocols.

It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the switches and links available for providing network services. Any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission-critical network outages. 

A DoS attack targeting the RP can result in excessive CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability and RP security, the switch must be able to handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to the RP. In the past, one method of filtering was to use ingress filters on forwarding interfaces to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces and the size of the ingress filters grow. 

Control plane policing increases the security of switches and multilayer switches by protecting the RP from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect switches against reconnaissance and DoS attacks, allowing the control plane to maintain packet forwarding and protocol states despite an attack or heavy load on the switch or multilayer switch.",,"Review the Cisco switch configuration to verify that is protects against known types of DoS attacks by employing organization-defined security safeguards. 

Step 1: Verify traffic types have been classified based on importance levels. The following is an example configuration: 

class-map match-all CoPP_CRITICAL 
match access-group name CoPP_CRITICAL 
class-map match-any CoPP_IMPORTANT 
match access-group name CoPP_IMPORTANT 
match protocol arp 
class-map match-all CoPP_NORMAL 
match access-group name CoPP_NORMAL 
class-map match-any CoPP_UNDESIRABLE 
match access-group name CoPP_UNDESIRABLE 
class-map match-all CoPP_DEFAULT 
match access-group name CoPP_DEFAULT 

Step 2: Review the access control lists (ACLs) referenced by the class maps to determine if the traffic is being classified appropriately. The following is an example configuration: 

ip access-list extended CoPP_CRITICAL 
remark our control plane adjacencies are critical 
permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any 
permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any 
permit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any 
permit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any 
permit pim host [RP addr] any 
permit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 
deny ip any any 

ip access-list extended CoPP_IMPORTANT 
permit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any 
permit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22 
permit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp 
permit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any 
deny ip any any 

ip access-list extended CoPP_NORMAL 
remark we will want to rate limit ICMP traffic 
permit icmp any any echo 
permit icmp any any echo-reply 
permit icmp any any time-exceeded 
permit icmp any any unreachable 
deny ip any any 

ip access-list extended CoPP_UNDESIRABLE 
remark other management plane traffic that should not be received 
permit udp any any eq ntp 
permit udp any any eq snmp 
permit tcp any any eq 22 
permit tcp any any eq 23 
remark other control plane traffic not configured on switch 
permit eigrp any any 
permit udp any any eq rip 
deny ip any any 

ip access-list extended CoPP_DEFAULT 
permit ip any any 

Note: Explicitly defining undesirable traffic with ACL entries enables the network operator to collect statistics. Excessive ARP packets can potentially monopolize Route Processor resources, starving other important processes. Currently, ARP is the only Layer 2 protocol that can be specifically classified using the match protocol command. 

Step 3: Review the policy-map to determine if the traffic is being policed appropriately for each classification. The following is an example configuration: 

policy-map CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY 
class CoPP_CRITICAL 
police 512000 8000 conform-action transmit exceed-action transmit 
class CoPP_IMPORTANT 
police 256000 4000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop 
class CoPP_NORMAL 
police 128000 2000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop 
class CoPP_UNDESIRABLE 
police 8000 1000 conform-action drop exceed-action drop 
class CoPP_DEFAULT 
police 64000 1000 conform-action transmit exceed-action drop 

Step 4: Verify that the Control Plane Policing (CoPP) policy is enabled. The following is an example configuration: 

control-plane 
service-policy input CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY 

Note: Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to filter as well as police control plane traffic destined to the RP. CPPr is very similar to CoPP and has the ability to filter and police traffic using finer granularity by dividing the aggregate control plane into three separate categories: 1) host, 2) transit, and 3) CEF-exception. Hence, a separate policy-map could be configured for each traffic category.

Step 1: Verify that ACLs have been configured as shown in the example below that matches expected control plane and management plane traffic. With the exception of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), all other traffic destined to the switch should be dropped.

Note: For the internal ACL example, all switches within the hypothetical network (10.1.0.0/16) have been configured to use the loopback address to source all management traffic (not shown); hence, the loopbacks are the only allowable destination address for management traffic. In addition, all management traffic destined to the switch must originate from the management network (10.2.1.0/24). With the exception of link-local control plane traffic and ICMP, all other traffic destined to any physical interface address will be dropped. 

Step 2: Verify that the ACL has been applied to the appropriate interface as shown in the example below:

The directed broadcast is routed through the network as a unicast packet until it arrives at the target subnet, where it is converted into a link-layer broadcast. Because of the nature of the IP addressing architecture, only the last switch in the chain, which is connected directly to the target subnet, can conclusively identify a directed broadcast. 

IP directed broadcasts are used in the extremely common and popular smurf, or denial-of-service (DoS), attacks. In a smurf attack, the attacker sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests from a falsified source address to a directed broadcast address, causing all the hosts on the target subnet to send replies to the falsified source. By sending a continuous stream of such requests, the attacker can create a much larger stream of replies, which can completely inundate the host whose address is being falsified. This service should be disabled on all interfaces when not needed to prevent smurf and DoS attacks. 

Directed broadcast can be enabled on internal-facing interfaces to support services such as Wake-On-LAN. Case scenario may also include support for legacy applications where the content server and the clients do not support multicast. The content servers send streaming data using UDP broadcast. Used in conjunction with the IP multicast helper-map feature, broadcast data can be sent across a multicast topology. The broadcast streams are converted to multicast and vice versa at the first-hop switches and last-hop switches before entering and leaving the multicast transit area respectively. The last-hop switch must convert the multicast to broadcast. Hence, this interface must be configured to forward a broadcast packet (i.e., a directed broadcast address is converted to the all nodes broadcast address).",,"Review the switch configuration to determine if IP directed broadcast is disabled.

The management interface can be a true OOBM interface or a standard interface functioning as the management interface. In either case, the management interface of the managed network element will be directly connected to the OOBM network. 

An OOBM interface does not forward transit traffic, thereby providing complete separation of production and management traffic. Since all management traffic is immediately forwarded into the management network, it is not exposed to possible tampering. The separation also ensures that congestion or failures in the managed network do not affect the management of the device. 

If the device does not have an OOBM port, the interface functioning as the management interface must be configured so that management traffic does not leak into the managed network and production traffic does not leak into the management network.",,"This requirement is only applicable where management access to the switch is via an OOBM interface, which is not a true OOBM interface. 

Step 1: Verify that the managed interface has an inbound and outbound access control list (ACL) configured.

Step 3: Verify that the egress ACL blocks any transit traffic.

Note: On Cisco switches, local generated packets are not inspected by outgoing interface access lists. Hence, the above configuration would drop any packets not generated by the switch, blocking any transit traffic.

Because there is no need to build cache entries when traffic starts arriving for new destinations, CEF behaves more predictably when presented with large volumes of traffic addressed to many destinations such as a SYN flood attacks that. Because many SYN flood attacks use randomized source addresses to which the hosts under attack will reply to, there can be a substantial amount of traffic for a large number of destinations that the switch will have to handle. Consequently, switches configured for CEF will perform better under SYN floods directed at hosts inside the network than switches using the traditional cache.
